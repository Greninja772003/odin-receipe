<p class="para">A treat for parents and children, here's a decadent 3-ingredient, and guess what, we donâ€™t use gelatine or heavy cream in the filling. The best part, it is ready in 10 minutes. Isn't it already making you crave?</p>
<p class="ingre"><b>Ingredients:</b> <br>
           Cream cheese (Order gluten-free cream cheese from Epigamia!) <br>
Honey  <br>
Vanilla <br>
Oats <br>
Butter <br>
Cinnamon </p>
<p class="ste"><b>Steps</b> <br>
    In a bowl, add cream cheese, honey and vanilla, and whip until you get a smooth mixture. Keep it aside. <br>
Take a blender or a food processor and add oats, butter, cinnamon and some honey. <br>
Blend till you get a crumbly mixture that sticks together. <br>
It's time to combine both the mixtures. In a cupcake mould, gently create a base with oats mixture. <br>
Now smear the base with the prepared cream cheese filling. <br>
Top it off with strawberry slices and refrigerate for 2-3 hours. <br>
Serve cold! </p></div>
